A collection of Python modules by [William Martinez](https://github.com/WilliamAMartinez) and [Lucas Braun](https://github.com/lbraun/)

### About

Google allows its users to download their location history data through its [Takeout](https://takeout.google.com) service. With this code, we are attempting to make the data more accessible.

For a full explanation of the project, please see our [ESRI Story Map](https://ivv6.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=5087d14c8f7d447fad8c1d3ee9f06ad0).

### Features

We provide functions to load the data provided by Google into Python and to convert it into CSVs or ESRI shapefiles. See [examples.py](examples.py) for a demonstration of use.
